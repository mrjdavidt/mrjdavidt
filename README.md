## Thank you for stopping by my Git. I will try to keep this README short as this specific profile is meant to act as a toolkit/portfolio of sorts.
## Throughout my profile you will come across varying repositories. These repositories will more than likely be one of three things-
## a code solution for handling some specific tricky input for a school assignment and the like, an example of a tweeked algorithmic expression (like my take on representing Planck's constant for example).
## The third type of entry you may come across are references to projects I've collaborated on for open source work.
## If you find any of my work useful feel free to apply it how you see fit. I find attributing credit for code sample defeating to the aspect of educational democratization. 
##I am also under no illusions that any work I've done is completley original as we "Stand on the shoulders of Giants" so they say.
## Cheers to you and good luck to us in our endeavours.
